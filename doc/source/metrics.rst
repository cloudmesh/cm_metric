Cloud Metrics supports a convenient shell to aide in the cloud usage
data analysis. It is advisable that users use the shell in case you
like to conduct multiple analysis steps.  The shell is designed to
read a user's input, calculate metrics data, and then provide the
results in an appropriate format such as a standard output, JSON, JPG,
PNG, and html with javascript charting libraries embedded

.. There are currently eight different metrics to deliver system utilization, user activities and statistics. These statistical data are collected from log files which contain trackable information and from administrative command tools like euca2ools. The metrics system has simple operations to measure specific items such as virtual machine (VM) instances, registered VM images, virtual system resources, etc and there are count, average, sum, max, and min functions. In this section, you can find descriptions, instructions, and examples for the metrics.

Starting the cloud metric shell
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To activate the metric shell please execute the command::

 $ cm-metric

Once you do this you can issue some of the metric shell commands. Here
is a simple example that analyzes the runtime metric for a machine
india on which openstack is installed and prints a chart::

 set nodename india
 set platform openstack
 set metric runtime
 analyze
 chart 

The  "set" Command
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before performing an analysis, several settings need to be specified
with the ``set`` command. This command allows to associate
one or more values with a key::

  cm-metric> set $key $value[ $value2 ...]

Set the date range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To analyze data between these two dates please set the date range::
 
  cm-metric> set date 2012-01-01T00:00:00 2012-12-31T23:59:59


Set the metric
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To specify  which metric item will be calculated please set it as follows::

  cm-metric> set metric runtime

  (multiple metrics)
  cm-metric> set metric runtime count

We are supporting the following metrics::
 
 cm-metric> set metric help
 Possible commands
 =================
  set metric count
  set metric runtime
  set metric countusers
  set metric cores
  set metric runtimeusers
  set metric memories
  set metric disks

Set the hostname
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As our metric system can handle multiple coulds, it is important to
set for which host the calculations are to be specified. Please set it
ass follows where the name india is your machine that holds the IaaS::

  cm-metric> set hostname india


Set the cloud service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To specify which cloud service will be included please use the
following command::

  cm-metric> set platform openstack

The "help" command
----------------------------------------------------------------------


The ``help`` command is useful to obtain a simple help message for the
available commoand::

  cm-metric> help

  Documented commands (type help <topic>):
  ========================================
  _load           clear           edit     l     pause    run      shell
  _relative_load  cmdenvironment  get      li    py       save     shortcuts
  analyze         csv             hi       list  r        set      show
  chart           ed              history  load  refresh  setconf  showconf

  Undocumented commands:
  ======================
  EOF  eof  exit  help  q  quit

.. todo::  document the undocumented commands and include new output here once done.

To find out more details about an available shell command, simply type
in help followed by the command::

  cm-metric> help set
  Set a function with parameter(s)

  cm-metric> set help

  Possible commands
  =================
  set date $from $to
  set metric $name
  set platform $name
  set nodename $name

To ask for help for a parameter you can do this as follows (here we
give an example for finding mor out about the set data command::

  cm-metric> set date help
  Usage: set date from_date(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) to_date(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS). 
  (e.g. set date 2012-01-01T00:00:00 2012-12-31T23:59:59)

The "analyze" command
----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo::  Hyungro

Once you conducted an analyze, cloud metrics supports several output
options such as stdout, JSON, csv, jpg, png, html that can be created
with the help of various commands such as chart and csv which we
describe next.

.. todo::  Hyungro, what about the other commands? I do not think they are listed here.

The "chart" command
----------------------------------------------------------------------

``chart`` is a command to create a chart html file with different
chart types (e.g. bar, line, column, etc.).  To help understanding of
data, a type of charts should be selected carefully. Relationships
between data and chart type refer to proper representation.

Assume, the data is:

* historical representation of quantity, then the type of chart should
  be => a line chart with x-axis as date and y-axis as quantity.
  - daily metrics 

* just quantities of different groups, then the type of chart should be => a pie chart
  - comparison across cloud services, locations, projects.

Example usage of the ``chart`` command::

  cm-metric> ...(skipped)...
  cm-metric> analyze
  cm-metric> chart -t pie-basic --directory $directory_name

The "csv" command
----------------------------------------------------------------------

``csv`` ia a command to export statistics as a comma-separated values (csv) file.

Example usage of ``csv`` command::

  cm-metric> ...(skipped)...
  cm-metric> analyze
  cm-metric> csv
  2012-01-01T00:00:00-2013-01-01T00:00:00-runtime-openstack-india-dailyAll.csv is created

  (or)
  cm-metric> csv -o test/result.csv
  test/result.csv is created

Examples of using the metric shell
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We show now some examples to highlight how easy it is to generate
statistics with the metric shell.

Daily active user count
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example shows you how to retrieve data for a certain time period.
``set period daily`` provides statistics grouped by date. For example,
if the date settings cover 30 days, the statistics will have 30 record
sets instead of a single record.  The chart type can be selected with
``chart -t`` option. ``line-time-series`` is one of the types in
highcharts. For more details of the types, see here: 
`Highchart Demo <http://www.highcharts.com/demo/>`_. In our example we
create a chart that represents for each day the number of users using
a cloud services in a histogram over the specified period (see Figure
1). Using the script::

 clear
 set nodename sierra
 set date 2012-10-01T00:00:00 2012-12-31T23:59:59
 set period daily
 set metric countusers
 analyze
 chart -t line-time-series --directory 2012-Q4/

will result in the following image:

.. figure:: _static/examples/daily_active_user_count.png
   :scale: 70 %
   :alt: Daily active user count

   Figure 1. The count of active users. 

VMs count by Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example represents data in percentages for different project
groups. In this example, we use ``groupby`` instead of ``period`` in
the previous example. It will result in a pie chart showing the
fractions  of Launched VM instances by Project groups (Figure
2). Using the script::

 clear
 set nodename sierra
 set date 2012-10-01T00:00:00 2012-12-31T23:59:59
 set groupby project
 set metric count
 analyze
 chart -t pie-basic --directory 2012-Q4/

will result in the following image:

.. figure:: _static/examples/vms_count_by_project.png
   :scale: 70 %
   :alt: VMs count by Project

   Figure 2. VMs count by Project. 

Three metrics in a single chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example represents multiple data in a single chart with multiple
axes. ``combo-multi-axes`` allows to depict three metrics in a single
chart.    Here we show a chart that includes average monthly usage as
to Wall Hour (runtime), Count and the number of Users for VM instances
(Figure 3). Using the script::

 clear
 set nodename sierra
 set date 2012-10-01T00:00:00 2012-12-31T23:59:59
 set period monthly
 set metric runtime count countusers
 set timetype hour
 analyze
 chart -t combo-multi-axes --directory 2012-Q4/

will result in the following image:


.. figure:: _static/examples/three_metrics_in_a_single_chart.png
   :scale: 70 %
   :alt: Average Monthly Usage Data (Wall hour, Launched VMs, Users)

   Figure 3. Average Monthly Usage Data (Wall hour, Launched VMs, Users)

Create a summary table for the month of January
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following will create a table with data produced for the month of January::

    > cm-metric
    cm-metric> clear users
    cm-metric> analyze -M 01
    cm-metric> table --type users --separator ,  --caption Testing_the_csv_table
    cm-metric> quit

Naturally you could store this script in a file and pipe to cm-metric
in case you have more complex or repetitive analysis to do. 

Create a summary analysis for multiple month
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: TOODO: Why is this eucalyptus? 
.. note:: TOODO: Why not " " in -t argument?

Assume you like to create a nice html page directory with the analysis
of the data contained. This can be done as follows. Assume the
following contents is in the file analyze.txt::

    clear users
    analyze -M 01 -Y 2012
    createreport -d 2012-01 -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_India
    
    clear users
    analyze -M 02 -Y 2012
    createreport -d 2012-01 -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_India
  
    createreports 2012-01 2012-02

This page creates a beautiful report page with links to the generated
graphs contained in the directories specified. All index files in the
directories are printed before the images in the directory are
included. The resulting report is an html report.

To start the script, simply use::

    cat analyze.txt | cm-metric

This will produce a nice directory tree with all the data needed for a
display.

Python Program to create a summary analysis for multiple month
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: TOODO: Hyungro do the test and complete, this will help you getting your automatic example going
.. note:: TOODO: Why is this eucalyptus? 


The previous example has the disadvantage that one has to explicitly
copy the lines that we use to access the analysis. However as Python
includes loops, we can just use loops to create such a script
programatically, while changing some parameters at the beginning::

  #! /usr/bin/env python
  from sh import cm-metric as metric

  filename = "/tmp/analyze.txt"

  years = ['2013']
  months =['01', '02']

  script = """
  clear users
  analyze -M %s(month) -Y %s(year)
  createreport -d %s(year)-result -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_%s(host)
  """
  ###############################
  # DO NOT CHANGE FRM HERE
  #
  # Assampble the anzlyses to be done 

  f = open (filename, "w") 

  for year in years:
    for  month in months:
       data = {"year": year, "month": month}
       print >>f, script % data 
  close f
  # finish the script 

  metric("-f", filename)

Naturaly this programm pattern can be used for more cases such as
identifying the current time and generating based on this scripts the
automatically create new alanysis, or the detection if an analysis was
already performed and skipping it. Hence it is possible to create a
fast script that does not need to recreate the majority of the
calculations, but only injects new data and calculate metrics based on
this new data.
