Shell to analyze data
---------------------

The purpose of our framework is to identify and analyze data from
various production clouds. Relevant data will be uploaded into a
database.  We have several convenient mechanisms to deal with the
data.  We can create summary of the data and can export in a variety
of formats. This summary is especially important for administrators
who like to find out what is happening on their clouds, but also for
users to see with who they compete for resources. The output format
includes png, googlecharts, and cvs tables.  As part of our analysis
we are also developing an interactive shell that can be used to query
data directly from our database. Some simple example illustrate our
usage of the shell.

The following picture gives an overview on which components are
communicating with each other to gather and display the data

 .. graphviz::

   digraph foo {
      graph [rankdir=LR];
      "Log Cloud A" -> "Backup";
      "Log Cloud B" -> "Backup";
      "          ...      " -> "Backup";
      "Log Cloud N" -> "Backup";
      "Backup" -> "Database";
      "Database" -> "Shell";
      "Database" -> "Portal";
      "Portal" -> "Portal User";
      "Shell" -> "Shell User";
   }

1. various clouds produce many log files
2. the log files will be moved to a backup directory
3. the log files that have been recently moved will be inspected and
     their contents will be added to the database
4. the database is queried by a cm-metric commandwhich is a simple
     shell that allows to quey for some very elementary iformation. It also
     allows to generate graphics for this information and place them in
     a web server
5. For our portal we havechosen not to use an interactive portal that
     interacts with the database on demand, but to just provide a static
     directory tree in sphinx that will be refreshed from ime to time.
     (This is sufficient for our current use case

To show some commands of the shell we have provided a small set of
examples.
 
Examples
--------

Create a summary table for the month of January
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following will create a table with data produced for the month of January::

    > cm-metric
    cm-metric> clear users
    cm-metric> analyze -M 01
    cm-metric> table --type users --separator ,  --caption Testing_the_csv_table
    cm-metric> quit

Naturally you could store this script in a file and pipe to cm-metric
in case you have more complex or repetitive analysis to do. 

Create a summary analysis for multiple month
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume you like to create a nice html page directory with the analysis
of the data contained. This can be done as follows. Assume the
following contents is in the file analyze.txt::

    clear users
    analyze -M 01 -Y 2012
    createreport -d 2012-01 -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_India
    
    clear users
    analyze -M 02 -Y 2012
    createreport -d 2012-01 -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_India
  
    createreports 2012-01 2012-02

This page creates a beautiful report page with links to the generated
graphs contained in the directories specified. All index files in the
directories are printed before the images in the directory are
included. The resulting report is an html report.

To start the script, simply use::

    cat analyze.txt | cm-metric

This will produce a nice directory tree with all the data needed for a
display.

Show machine image counts for Eucalyptus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on Jonathan's code, we are able to get image counts via cmd2 tools.
It's established on 'euca-describe-images' command::

        (Cmd) count_images
        ...
        sazh72  1
        debian-rm1984   1
        pegasus-images  3
        wchen-server-stage-1    2
        ...

There are additional options which might be useful,

1. showing only image numbers owned by the userid specified::

    (Cmd) count_image -u jdiaz
    jdiaz   7
   
2. displaying details about images::

        (Cmd) count_images -u jdiaz -d
        jdiaz   7
        IMAGE   emi-1CA015A7    centos-image-bucket/centos.5-3.x86-64.img.manifest.xml  taklwu  available       public          x86_64  machine eki-78EF12D2    eri-5BB61255    instance-store

3. displaying summary values about images.
    e.g. total image counts, total user counts, average image counts 
    per user, and maximum image counts and userid::

        (Cmd) count_images -s
        ...
        = Summary =
        Total image counts:     128
        Total user counts:      71
        Average image counts per user:  1.80281690141
        Maximum image counts and userid:        ajyounge has 12

Eucalyptus 2.0
--------------

Data gathering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eucalyptus provides a substantial set of log information. The
information is stored in the eucalyptus log directory.  Typically it
is configured by the system administrator with log rotation. This
naturally would mean that the information is lost after a time period
specified by the log rotation configuration. There are two mechanisms
of avoiding this. The first method is to change the eucalyptus
configuration files in order to disable log rotation. However this has
the disadvantage that the directories may fill up and eucalyptus runs
out of space.  How to disable Eucalyptus log rotation is discussed in
the manaula at ... .  However we decided to go another route, buy
copying the Eucalyptus log files after a particular period of time and
place them onto our analysis server and also a backup server. To set
this mechanism up, a Eucalyptus system administrator simply can
install our tools in a predefined directory and call a command that
copies the log files. Ideally This is integrated into a cron script so
that the process is done on regular basis.

To switch on eucalyptus in debug mode 'EUCADEBUG'  you will have to do the
following

    TODO

Here is how you set this up::

    pip install cloudmesh.cloud.metric
    
This will install several commands in the bin directory. Make sure
that it is in your path

Now you can call the command::

    cm-euca-gather-log-files

A more detailed description is provided as part of the
`cm-euca-gather-log-files <./man/cm-euca-gather-log-files.html>`_
manual page
   
which will copy all logfiles that has not yet been copied into our
backup directory. The log files have a numerical value from 1 to 9 as
a postfix Once this is done, our analysis scripts can be called from
the commandline or a web page to create information about usage and
utilization.

To see more information about this command, please visit the manual
page [cm-euca-gather-log-files](./man/cm-euca-gather-log-files.md)
