LOG ANALYZER FOR CLOUDS v2.1
============================

INTRODUCTION

---------------------
Shell to analyze data
---------------------

The purpose of our framework is to identify and analyze data from
various production clouds. Relevant data will be uploaded into a
database.  We have several convenient mechanisms to deal with the
data.  We can create summary of the data and can export in a variety
of formats. This summary is especially important for administrators
who like to find out what is happening on their clouds, but also for
users to see with who they compete for resources. The output format
includes png, googlecharts, and cvs tables.  As part of our analysis
we are also developing an interactive shell that can be used to query
data directly from our database. Some simple example illustrate our
usage of the shell. 
 
Example: Create a summary table for the month of January
========================================================

The following will create a table with data produced for the month of January::

    > fg-metric
    fg> clear users
    fg> analyze -M 01
    fg> table --type users --separator ,  --caption Testing_the_csv_table
    fg> quit

Naturally you could store this script in a file and pipe to fg-metric
in case you have more complex or repetitive analysis to do. 

Example: How to create a summary analysis for multiple month
============================================================

Assume you like to create a nice html page directory with the analysis
of the data contained. This can be done as follows. Assume the following 
contents is in the file analyze.txt::

    clear users
    analyze -M 01 -Y 2012
    createreport -d 2012-01 -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_India
    
    clear users
    analyze -M 02 -Y 2012
    createreport -d 2012-01 -t Running_instances_per_user_of_Eucalyptus_in_India
  
    createreports 2012-01 2012-02

This page creates a beautiful report page with links to the generated
graphs contained in the directories specified. All index files in
the directories are printed before the images in the directory are
included. The resulting report is an html report.

To start the script, simply use::

    cat analyze.txt | fg-metric

This will produce a nice directory tree with all the data needed for a
display.

-------------------------------
Eucalyptus 2.0 Data Integration
-------------------------------

To achieve analysis of eucalyptus data, we are using 'cc.log'
files. The needed information must be gathered while eucalyptus runs
in 'EUCADEBUG' mode. We assume the following directory layout::

    ./futurgrid/
    ./futurgrid/bin - includes all commands needed to run the log analyzing
    ./futurgrid/lib - includes libraries that may be called from the bin files
    ./futurgrid/etc - location of configuration files
    ./futurgrid/www - location of the www files
    
    
Eucalyptus data gathering
=========================

Eucalyptus provides a substantial set of log information. The
information is typically stored in the eucalyptus log directory
Typically it is also configured by the system administrator with log
rotation. This naturally would mean that the information is lost after
a time period specified by the log rotation configuration. There are
two mechanisms of avoiding this. The first method is to change the
eucalyptus configuration files in order to disable log
rotation. However this has the disadvantage that the directories may
fill up and eucalyptus runs out of space.  How to disable Eucalyptus
log rotation is discussed in the manaula at ... .  However we decided
to go another route, buy copying the Eucalyptus log files after a
particular period of time and place them onto our analysis server and
also a backup server. To set this mechanism up, a Eucalyptus system
administrator simply can install our tools in a predefined directory
and call a command that copies the log files. Ideally This is
integrated into a cron script so that the process is done on regular
basis.

Here is how you set this up::

    pip install ....
    
This will install several commands in the bin directory. Make sure
that it is in your path

Now you can call the command::

   [fg-euca-gather-log-files](./man/fg-euca-gather-log-files.md)
   
which will copy all logfiles that has not yet been copied into our
backup directory. The log files have a numerical value from 1 to 9 as
a postfix Once this is done, our analysis scripts can be called from
the commandline or a web page to create information about usage and
utilization.

To see more information about this command, please visit the manual
page [fg-euca-gather-log-files](./man/fg-euca-gather-log-files.md)


----
TODO
----

define variables::

    CM_LOG_ANALYZER_WWW_OUTPUT - location where the www files for display are stored
    CM_TMP - location where temporary files are located that are analyzed
    CM_DATA - location where the permanent data is being stored 
    CM_HOME_LOG_ANALYZER - is set to the location of the "futuregrid" directory.
    EUCALYPTUS_LOG_DIR - location where the eucalyptus log dirs are stored

We recommend that the FutureGrid directory is included in the PATH of
the shell that will run the commands.

INSTALLATION
------------


Installation from pypi 
======================

The programs are distributed in [pypi](xyz). It contains our current release version of the software. 


Installation form the source in github
======================================

If you are adventures, you can work with our newest code checked into
github. To obtain this code, please conduct the following steps.  We
assume you have root privileges to execute "make force"::

    wget https://github.com/futuregrid/futuregrid-cloud-metrics/tarball/v2.1.1
    tar xvzf v2.1.1
    cd futuregrid-futuregrid-cloud-metrics-4635fc9
    make force 
    
This will install the programs in::

    /usr/bin/
    
What to do if I do not have root privilege
==========================================

If you do not have root privileges, you can also install the program
via pythons virtualenv.

Note: Please see our documentation on virtual cluster on how to do that ;-)


--------
COMMANDS
--------

[fg-cleanup-db](./man/fg-cleanup-db.md)

erases the content of the database

[fg-parser](./man/fg-parser.md)

parses eucalyptus log entries and includes them into the database


[fg-euca-gather-log-files](./man/fg-euca-gather-log-files.md)

gathers all eucalyptus log files into a single directory from the
eucalyptus log file directory. This script can be called from cron
repeatedly in order to avoid that log data is lost by using log file
rotation in eucalyptus.


[fg-metric](./man/fg-metric.md)

a shell to interact with the metric database.
