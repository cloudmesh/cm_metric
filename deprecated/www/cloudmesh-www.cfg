# Contents of $data4graphs directory
# ----------------------------------
# In $data4graphs, there should be 'YYYYMM' typed directories and each of the directory has multiple data files.
# The multiple data files are follows:
# 1) 2 PNGs for pie, bar charts
# 2) 1 html for displaying the PNGs
# 3) 1 html for Google Motion Chart
# 4) 1 csv file for analyzed data
